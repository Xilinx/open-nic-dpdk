## Instructions for Getting DPDK Drivers Up and Running on AMD OpenNIC 

This is one of the three components of the
[OpenNIC project](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic.git).  The other components are:
- [OpenNIC shell](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell.git) and
- [OpenNIC driver](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-driver.git).

This OpenNIC DPDK repo contains a series of patch files and instructions with details for building DPDK with drivers for [OpenNIC](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic).  The basic sections are:

1. Install Build Dependencies.
1. The drivers at [Xilinx QDMA's DPDK driver repo](https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers) need to be patched for OpenNIC using the patch files contained in this repo.
1. Download DPDK and DPDK pktgen. The DPDK 20.11 distribution needs minor edits to include these drivers.
1. Build.
1. Configure proc/cmdline and BIOS if necessary.
1. Run Vivado to generate the [open-nic-shell](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell) configured for two CMAC ports and two PFs for testing these.
1. Gives examples for writing to the hardware registers in order to set up the test.
1. Gives examples for binding DPDK to devices and testing this driver by running pktgen for the two PFs.

The rest of this document contains the step-by-step instructions for each of the sections listed above.  These instructions were written assuming Ubuntu e.g. 18.04 or 20.04.

### Section 1: Install Build Dependencies

1.  Install dependencies for building DPDK:
    ```
    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt install libnuma-dev
    sudo apt install pkg-config
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools
    sudo apt install python3-wheel python3-pyelftools
    sudo apt install ninja-build
    sudo pip3 install meson
    ```    

1.  Install dependencies for building pktgen-dpdk:
    ```
    sudo apt install libpcap-dev
    ```
    
    Substitute the kernel version from "uname -a" into the command
    below:
    ```
    sudo apt install linux-headers-5.4.0-96-generic
    ```


### Section 2: Download Xilinx QDMA DPDK driver and Apply OpenNIC Patches

1.  This repo contains several patch files that must be applied to the [Xilinx QDMA DPDK drivers](https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers.git).
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers.git
    cd dma_ip_drivers
    git checkout 7859957
    cd ..
    ```

1.  Clone this open-nic-dpdk repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-dpdk
    ```

1.  Copy the `*.patch` files contained in this repo into the QDMA driver's directory.
    ```
    cp open-nic-dpdk/*.patch dma_ip_drivers
    ```
    
1.  Then apply the OpenNIC patches:
    ```
    cd dma_ip_drivers
    git apply *.patch
    cd ..
    ```

### Section 3: Download DPDK and pktgen-dpdk

1.  Download [DPDK source](https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-20.11.tar.xz) and build it, including the QDMA drivers.

    ```
    wget https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-20.11.tar.xz
    tar xvf dpdk-20.11.tar.xz
    cd dpdk-20.11
    cp -R ../dma_ip_drivers/QDMA/DPDK/drivers/net/qdma ./drivers/net
    cp -R ../dma_ip_drivers/QDMA/DPDK/examples/qdma_testapp ./examples
    ```

1.  Edit `drivers/net/meson.build` to insert `'qdma'` into the list of drivers (~near line 46).  Save the changes.

1.  Return to the earlier directory:
    ```
    cd ..
    ```

1.  Download [pktgen-dpdk source](https://git.dpdk.org/apps/pktgen-dpdk/snapshot/pktgen-dpdk-pktgen-20.11.3.tar.xz) and build it, including the QDMA drivers.
    ```
    wget \
    https://git.dpdk.org/apps/pktgen-dpdk/snapshot/pktgen-dpdk-pktgen-20.11.3.tar.xz
    tar xvf pktgen-dpdk-pktgen-20.11.3.tar.xz
    ```

### Section 4: Build



1.  Build DPDK:
    ```
    cd dpdk-20.11
    meson build
    cd build
    ninja
    sudo ninja install
    ls -l /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librte_net_qdma.so
    sudo ldconfig
    ls -l ./app/test/dpdk-test
    cd ../..
    ```

1.  Build pktgen-dpdk:
    ```
    cd pktgen-dpdk-pktgen-20.11.3
    make RTE_SDK=../dpdk-20.11 RTE_TARGET=build
    ```


### Section 5: Configure proc/cmdline and BIOS if necessary


1.  Make sure that IOMMU is enabled within the BIOS settings.

    *Note: Enable VT-d for Intel processors within the BIOS.*

1.  Set grub settings to enable hugepages and IOMMU if necessary. The
    following example grub command line below is based on an AMD machine
    with e.g. 16GB of RAM, so please adjust the number of hugepages below
    as appropriate.

    Edit `/etc/default/grub` to include the following line:

    `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=" default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=4"`

    *Note: Add* `intel_iommu=on` *above for Intel processors.*

1.  Update grub:
    ```
    sudo update-grub
    ```

1.  Reboot for the changes to take effect.
    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```

1.  Confirm that hugepages appears within the `/proc/cmdline`:
    ```
    cat /proc/cmdline
    ```
    
### Section 6: Create the OpenNIC bitfile configured for two CMAC ports

1.  Clone the latest version of the open-nic-shell from github (including
    some updates after 1.0 release).
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell.git
    ```
1.  Follow the instructions within
    <https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell> for building the bitfile
    including specifying the appropriate board and also the following
    parameters: `-num_cmac_port 2 -num_phys_func 2`.

1.  Open Vivado to complete the implementation and to generate the bitfile.

1.  Use Vivado to load the bitfile.

1.  Either reboot or pci rescan to redectect the pci devices, for example:
    ```
    echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:d7\:00.0/rescan
    sudo setpci -s d8:00.0 COMMAND=0x02
    ```

### Section 7: Writing to Initialize the OpenNIC hardware registers

1.  Find the pcie bus and device ID for the two PFs:
    ```
    $ lspci -d 10ee:
    ```
    > 08:00.0 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 903f
    >
    > 08:00.1 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 913f

    Below is an example of finding the sysfile name of the device ID:
    ```
    $ lspci -td 10ee:
    ```
    > -+-[0000:d8]-+-00.0
    > |           \-00.1
    > \-[0000:00]-
    ```
    $ cd -P /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:d8:00.0 && pwd
    ```
    > /sys/devices/pci0000:d7/0000:d7:00.0/0000:d8:00.0

1.  Use a utility program such as pcimem or similar to write to enable
        the CMAC registers and the QDMA.

    The following example writes should be modified for your pcie device
    sysfile name. Perform the following register writes.
    
    Enable the PCIe device for writing:
    ```
    sudo setpci -s 08:00.0 COMMAND=0x02;

    sudo setpci -s 08:00.1 COMMAND=0x02;
    ```
    Write to QDMA:
    ```
    sudo pcimem \
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/resource2 0x1000 w 0x1;

    sudo pcimem \
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/resource2 0x2000 w 0x00010001;
    ```
    Write to enable CMAC0:
    ```
    sudo pcimem \
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/resource2 0x8014 w 0x1;

    sudo pcimem \
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/resource2 0x800c w 0x1;
    ```
    Write to enable CMAC1:
    ```
    sudo pcimem \
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/resource2 0xC014 w 0x1;

    sudo pcimem \
    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/resource2 0xC00c w 0x1;
    ```
### Section 8: Binding DPDK and Testing by Running pktgen

1.  Edit dpdk-devbind.py so that it can find the qdma PCIe class/vendor/device, for example like below.  
        (The file dpdk-devbind.diff in this repo also contains these same lines from diff.)
    ```
    31a32,35
    >
    > qdma = {'Class: '02', 'Vendor': '10ee', 'Device': '903f,913f',
    >               'SVendor': None, 'SDevice': None}
    >
    62c66
    < network_devices = [network_class, cavium_pkx, avp_vnic, ifpga_class]
    ---
    > network_devices = [network_class, cavium_pkx, avp_vnic, ifpga_class, qdma]
    ```

2.  Load dpdk-devbind.py with arguments for vfio and the two pcie bus and device identifiers:  
    ```
    sudo dpdk_patched/dpdk-20.11/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci \
	08:00.0 08:00.1
    ```
3.  Test by running pktgen-dpdk (note the command below specifies example device IDs
        and bus IDs for the two PFs, please substitute with the appropriate IDs):
    ```
    sudo dpdk_patched/pktgen-dpdk/usr/local/bin/pktgen -a 08:00.0 -a 08:00.1 \
    -d librte_net_qdma.so -l 4-10 -n 4 -a 00:03.0 -a 00:03.1 -- -m [6:7].0 -m [8:9].1
    ```
